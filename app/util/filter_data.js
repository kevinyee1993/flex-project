//This file used to filter db results based on what the user enters
//for their survey

//need to define the params that we should take or whatever feel me
//actually for activities, just need to take a name param that will
//be determined by the AI
//check if it's going to be an array of activities that are going to be
//passed and if you need to grab all of them

//might need to create another filter data for restaurants/lodging
//or update this one to account for those as well

//after user completes survey, need that data
//then need to send all of this data back to the user
//figure out how to do this


//put the query in the params rather than creating it yourself in line 29
