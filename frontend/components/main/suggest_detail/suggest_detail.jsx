The staff said he didn't work there, which I knew for sure, he did! A guy with an accent was very rude to me, he would not give me his name. He said he would block my number. This type of service does not reflect well for a 4 star hotel, which St. Regis claims they are!!!! I was on the verge of tears & still was not able to contact my husband. Please train your staff at better customer service when it comes to phone conversations! The manager needs to be held responsible for un professional staff, especially the guy who refused to give me his name & threatened to block my calls. Extremely rude!! From a VERY upset wife!!",

Everyone goes out of their way to make it a great experience. We stayed in a corner room, not a suite but definitelyBetter than a regular room.We had drinks at the bar downstairs, the bartender made a delicious tequila cocktail off menu. It had jalepeno, citrus, and I believe a little agave. It was delightful and I wish I had asked how to make it. We ate at the grill one morning, they made lovely lattes. We also had frittata, definitely was not good. It tasted like hotel food but that's a review for the restaurant. Valet parking is 60/ day just be mindful of that!! Definitely a pricey place to stay but was a good time.",

Our children (ages 1,5,7) felt so special being given a stuffed animal upon check-in, then later little coloring packets and a puzzle. In the bathroom was a little baby bathroom kit with baby wash, etc which was just one more unexpected thing to appreciate when traveling. They really do not miss a beat. The rooms are beautiful and the location is great. Will definitely be back :)",

A hotel with evening turn-down service is an extra bit of luxury I love. Coming back after a long day of travel and fun I'm exhausted and ready to unwind for the night. Each night, we'd come back, the Bose Wave music system was playing some smooth jazz, lights dimmed, shades drawn, and night garments laid out. The St Regis was a nice two-day splurge and I throughly enjoyed myself.",

Every time I stay here I feel like royalty! The customer service that you receive here is exceptional; especially the butler service and access to the Bentley. I was fortunate enough to stay in one of the suites and it was glorious in every way imaginable. Some highlights included the bed which was like sleeping on clouds...not that I've ever slept on a cloud and the jacuzzi tub was relaxing to the tenth power.The St. Regis location is also great as it's close to the convention center, shopping on Market Street and in Union Square and the Bart that can get you to other areas such as the pier.",

It's more relaxing than Bliss. The rooms are really well designed, modern yet elegant. Watch out lower floors do sound noisier because of the busy downtown streets below. Walking distance to the Yerba Buena garden, downtown shopping, and the lobby bar and food is quite good too for staying in. The butler service is not available to common rooms. Even in suites the butlers have off times during holidays so one thing to watch out. It's more about the downtown access and overall amenity than the butler service in this St Regis",

At check-in, my toddlers were given teddy bears to keep them company during their stay. Super cute! Service is excellent. The gym and spa are both small and pretty standard. TIPs.- If you're traveling with family and need more than 1 bedroom, ask for adjourning bedrooms.- The suites do not have kitchens, but they'll provide a microwave upon request.",

Luxury does not equate being treated like a prostitute (more power to you ladies) simply for being a single woman alone. I would hope that in San Francisco, of all places, a woman would be safe from such assumptions. Not a place for women, queer individuals, or minorities.I will not spend another cent there.
